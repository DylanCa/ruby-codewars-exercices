# Ruby Codewars Exercices
___

Basically a repo with Codewars exercices I do to train with Ruby. Each folder will be named according to Codewars' difficulty, and each exercice will be put in its designed folder. Within each exercice source code, you will find an explaination of the exercice, my take on it and a few test lines to ensure my solution is working as intended.

__Please note__ that this folder isn't following strict Gitflow rules, and it is intended.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you feel the need to!
